USART Protocol

Here's an explanation of the UART protocol, which is closely related to USART:

1. Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART):
    - Description: UART is a simple and widely used serial communication protocol that allows for asynchronous data transmission between devices.
    - Two-Wire Communication:
        - Transmit (TX): The TX line carries data from the transmitting device to the receiving device.
        - Receive (RX): The RX line carries data from the receiving device to the transmitting device.
   
    - Asynchronous Communication: UART communication is asynchronous, meaning that data is transmitted without a shared clock signal. Instead, both the transmitting and receiving devices agree on a specific baud rate to synchronize the data transmission.
    - Start and Stop Bits: UART frames typically consist of a start bit, data bits (usually 8 bits), an optional parity bit for error checking, and one or more stop bits to signal the end of a data frame.
    - Applications: UART is commonly used for point-to-point communication between devices, such as microcontrollers, GPS modules, Bluetooth modules, and serial communication ports on computers.

USART, on the other hand, extends the capabilities of UART by adding synchronous communication support in addition to asynchronous communication. USART can operate in synchronous mode, where a shared clock signal is used to synchronize data transmission, in addition to the asynchronous mode supported by UART.

In summary, while USART includes both synchronous and asynchronous communication capabilities, UART specifically refers to the asynchronous mode of communication. Both protocols are widely used in embedded systems for serial communication between devices due to their simplicity, versatility, and compatibility with a wide range of devices and applications.
