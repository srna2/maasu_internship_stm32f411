Key Differences between Protocols
=================================

Key differences between SPI, I2C, and USART communication protocols:

1. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):
   - Communication Method: SPI is a full-duplex synchronous serial communication protocol that uses four wires (MISO, MOSI, SCK, SS) for communication.
   - Master-Slave Configuration: SPI operates in a master-slave configuration, where one master device controls communication with one or more slave devices.
   - Speed: SPI supports high-speed data transfer rates, making it suitable for applications that require fast communication.
   - Applications: SPI is commonly used in applications such as data storage, display drivers, ADCs, DACs, and communication with RF modules.

2. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit):
   - Communication Method: I2C is a multi-master, multi-slave synchronous serial communication protocol that uses two wires (SDA, SCL) for communication.
   - Addressing: I2C uses addressing to communicate with specific devices on the bus, allowing multiple devices to share the same bus.
   - Speed: I2C typically operates at lower speeds compared to SPI, making it suitable for communication over short distances within a circuit board.
   - Applications: I2C is commonly used in applications where multiple devices need to communicate over short distances, such as sensors, real-time clocks, and EEPROMs.

3. USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter):
   - Communication Method: USART is a versatile serial communication interface that supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication modes.
   - Asynchronous vs. Synchronous: USART can operate in asynchronous mode (UART) without a shared clock signal or synchronous mode with a shared clock signal.
   - Data Transfer: USART typically uses two wires (TX, RX) for communication in asynchronous mode, similar to UART.
   - Applications: USART is commonly used for point-to-point communication between devices, such as microcontrollers, GPS modules, Bluetooth modules, and serial communication ports on computers.

In summary, SPI is known for its high-speed full-duplex communication, I2C is favored for multi-master communication with addressing capabilities, and USART offers versatility with support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication modes.
