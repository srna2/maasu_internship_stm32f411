   --> Baud rate is the speed at which data is transmitted over a serial communication channel. It defines the number of bits transmitted per second.
       Oversampling refers to the process of sampling the data line multiple times per bit to improve data reliability and reduce noise.

   --> The "OVER8" bit in the USART Control Register configures the oversampling mode for USART communication. 
       When "OVER8" is set to 1, the USART operates with 8x oversampling, allowing for higher baud rates. When cleared to 0, the USART operates with 16x oversampling, providing more sampling points per bit for better accuracy in data reception.
